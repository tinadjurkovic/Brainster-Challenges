    Here is a short description of my workflow:

    1. Firstly, I went to GitLab and created a new private repository called: "Challenges-Konstantina-Gjurkovic-fs19", along with a README file.
    2. Then I've navigated to the "Members" section and added the appropriate assistant as a "Maintainer".
    3. The next step I've done is cloning the repository into my local machine using the command: git clone https://git.brainster.co/Konstantina.Gjurkovic/challenges-konstantina-gjurkovic-fs19.git
    4. Then i created a new branch manually from Gitlab: Branches -> New Branch -> Challenge-01-HTML (create from:main)
    5. After creating that new branch, I switched to that branch via the command: git checkout Challenge-01-HTML
    6. Once I was in the desired branch I copied the files of the Challenge-01-HTML that were stored in my local machine and put them in this new branch, since this challenge was completed weeks before we started using GitLab.
    7. Then, I executed the command: git status to see the modifications
    8. After that, I executed the commands: "git add ." to stage all changes for commit, and "git commit -m "Challenge-01-completed" to commit the changes with a message.
    9. Lastly, I execute the command: "git push origin "Challenge-01-HTML" to push the updated branch to Gitlab
    10. With these steps I've successfully uploaded the Challenge-01-HTML solution into it's corresponding branch.
    11. I repeat all of these steps starting from step 4 for the next challenges, in the same repository, leaving the main branch with the README file only..
